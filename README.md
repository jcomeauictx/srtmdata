Not that many years ago, it was possible to download SRTM3 data easily from
a USGS website, <https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3>, but that
page now returns a 404 error. The data is available at
<https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/>, but hidden behind layer upon layer of
webapp foolishness. This project will be an attempt to illuminate the steps
necessary, and perhaps automate some or all of it.
